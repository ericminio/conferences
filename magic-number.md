# How to leverage the MagicNumber pattern

## Magic what?

PrimeFactors Coding kata:

1. expect(primeFactorsOf(1492)).to.equal([2, 2, 373])
2. let primeFactorsOf = (number) => { return **[2, 2, 373]**; } // _hardcoded value: **MagicNumber** [[1]] code smell_

Then what?
And especially how is that useful for real life?
